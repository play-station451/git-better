# Git Better

> Git Better is currently under development.

### Why another self-hosted GitHub alternative?

I've found that GitHub and most self-hosted alternatives don't fully satisfy my needs. This repository was created to mimic GitHub features like Codespaces and Actions, while also including new features such as AI tools.

## Installation

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 22+
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/play-station451/git-better
cd git-better
npm install
npm start
```
